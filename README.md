Cloning UpGrad.com: A little functional and more visual clone.

Through this blog, I am going to share my journey of working on a team project as a web developer student at Masai School.
So I had a problem statement that I have to create a clone of a website called upGrad.com . Also I can use my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Advance Javascript, slick and cloud flair library and API knowledge.
On Monday, 13th of December, 2021 all the students at Masai school were divided into a team of five from their respective batches and assigned a project that they had to build within 2 weeks, and on the last day, from every batch best teams would be selected to present their project to the respective Judges. We had to build the project with whatever skills we were taught in unit 1, unit 2 and unit 3 at Masai school, so in my case, it was HTML, CSS, Javascript ,Advance Javascript and API Request. I was assigned to team 16 and my teammates were Sarthak Bakshi, Ashutosh Swaraj, Aditya Pathak and Sheelu.

Team Members and their contributions:

Ashish Shaw:
I created the Product details page with the help of HTML, CSS and Javascript. In addition to it I also created the Billing page with the same tools as in product details page.

Sarthak Bakshi:
created the Product page and Database Section.

Ashutosh Swaraj:
created Payment page with local storage connectivity.

Aditya Pathak:
created Login and SignUp page with local storage connectivity.

Sheelu:
created Homepage with sticky Product Section, Footer, Navbar, Sliders.

The blog is divided into three parts -
Firstly we will understand what the project statement is about.

At last, some input that I have learned while working on the project as a beginner will be shared.

Inputs for beginners-
This was the third project I worked on at Masai, and the things I’m going to share are stuff I realized, will benefit someone new to web development or who is going to work for the very first time on a project. So here it is.

The outcome and important learning from the project :-
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Although we could have done more such as we could have added timer and there were some more functionalities that could have been done, but yeah the time didn’t permitted us to go further. But we will surely improve it.
